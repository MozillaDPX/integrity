# building ethical products

At Mozilla, we work across product, law, policy, and ethics to design and develop ethical products that help users succeed and uphold basic human rights in societies around the world.

This is how we build a better internet: by creating products that (1) amplify the good, promoting greater individual autonomy and agency over digital experiences and (2) filter out the bad by actively combatting pervasive harmful practices, such as surveillance, data extraction, and manipulation. 

We are focused on five pillars of integrity in our products: privacy, security, safety, inclusion, and sustainability.

### mission: why we work
Advances Mozillaâ€™s mission to build a better internet by providing support for product design and development that respects people, communities, and context. 

### structure: how we work 
We are a horizontal engineering team focused on advancing products that respect people.

### description: what we do
The experience integrity team provides decision making criteria and engineering recommendations based on user value tradeoffs (related to privacy, security, safety, inclusion, and sustainability) for Mozilla products. 

This work enables the company to measure how our products are achieving unique differentiation across our manifesto values. The integrity team collaborates closely with our peers in design and research, governance teams around the organization, as well as product teams. 

The team delivers privacy and security solutions using cutting edge methods and consults with every product team in the organization as experts in building products that meet the integrity expectations of users.
To learn more about the experience integrity program at Mozilla, please check out our strategy deck [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_PcTB0kaJ6Ud612JTw-Yen0QI43NomonYFQdn336UkY/edit#slide=id.gafe21ebcbd_0_1170).

## program
The experience integrity program is available to help with requests to address risks to privacy, security, safety, inclusion, and sustainability in our products. 

1. Learn More: To learn more about Mozilla's framework for building ethical products, check out (and contribute to!) our [experience integrity toolkit]. 

2. self-assess, general: To establish an initial understanding of where your product/feature falls on the spectrum of integrity across the five core pillars, you can start with our baseline checklist. If your product/feature scores below a 5/10 on any one of the pillars on the baseline checklist, a pillar deep dive assessment may be requested.

3. self-assess, pillar deep dive: For a closer look at how your product/feature measures up in a particular area of integrity, you can use our Pillar Deep Dive self-assessment evaluation.

4. custom project: If you would like to log a request for a specific integrity project for your product/feature (generally touching strategy/roadmap decisions), please submit an issue [here](https://github.com/nshadowen314/product-integrity/issues/new?labels=zenhub-prod-integrity&template=prod_integrity_request.md). 

5. program idea/request: For ideas about how to make the experience integrity program better, please add issues using the following [template](https://github.com/nshadowen314/product-integrity/issues/new?labels=zenhub-prod-integrity&template=program_request.md).


## process

### self-assess
Use and contribute to our set of easy access resources built to serve internal and external product creators from product owners to user researchers.

1. toolkit
High level framework for shared terminology, standard best practices, and key resources for experience integrity across Mozilla products.

2. self-assessment checklist
Baseline checklist for primary product stakeholders: product owners, designers, user researchers, and engineers.

3. [resource repository](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2695011/experience_integrity_public/library)
Dynamic database of integrity related resources including industry guidelines, government regulations/frameworks, and academic research.

### consult
For internal teams at Mozilla, the experience integrity team is available to support in investigating product integrity needs that: 
* are not met through self-assessment process 
* product teams are not able to complete themselves 
* require multi-disciplinary and/or ethical expertise

For teams or product creators external to Mozilla and interested in the integrity program, we encourage you to get in touch! We love collaborating with our friends and colleagues across the industry: placeholder_email@mozilla.com. 

If you would like to be a participant in integrity at Mozilla, please get in touch! For those who are already Mozillians, become a part of our products for people advocacy group. For those external to the Mozilla community, consider tuning in or joining our advisory council of external experts.
