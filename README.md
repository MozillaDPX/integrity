## Product Integrity Program

### Mission statement: 
Enable product development that respects people, communities, and context. 

### Structure: 
We are a horizontal engineering team focused on advancing products that respect people.

### Program Description
The Product Integrity team provides decision making criteria and engineering recommendations based on user value tradeoffs (related to privacy, security, safety, inclusion, and sustainability) for Mozilla products. This work enables the company to measure how our products are achieving unique differentiation across our manifesto values. The Product Integrity team collaborates closely with our peers in Design and People Experiences, governance teams around the organization, as well as product teams. The team delivers privacy and security solutions using the most cutting edge methods and consults with every product team in the organization as experts in building products that meet the integrity expectations of users.

## Requesting Product Integrity Support
The product integrity program is available to help with any requests to address risks to privacy, security, safety, diversity and inclusion, and environmental sustainability in our products. 

1. Learn More: If you are not sure if your need falls within the scope of product integrity, please refer to the following [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1clkNScf22kL_UBBXzecnvXw3Nrc_K_LO0w15F3NzVa8/edit).

2. General Product Integrity Evaluation, self-assessment: To establish an initial understanding of where your product/feature falls on the spectrum of product integrity across the five core pillars, you can start with our "Baseline Product Integrity" checklist. If your product/feature scores below a 5/10 on any one of the pillars on the baseline checklist, a pillar deep dive assessment may be requested.

3. Pillar Deep Dive, self-assessment: For a closer look at how your product/feature measures up in a particular area of integrity, you can use our Pillar Deep Dive self-assessment evaluation.
    * Privacy
    * Security
    * Safety
    * Diversity and Inclusion
    * Environmental Sustainability

4. Custom project: If you would like to log a request for a specific product integrity project for your product/feature (generally touching strategy/roadmap decisions), please submit an issue [here](https://github.com/nshadowen314/product-integrity/issues/new?labels=zenhub-prod-integrity&template=prod_integrity_request.md).
