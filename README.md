# building ethical products

At Mozilla, we work across product, law, policy, and ethics to design and develop ethical products that help people succeed and uphold basic human rights in societies around the world.

Beyond words, public statements, or corporate missions - we believe in demonstrating our commitment to ethics through a measurable and systematic approach to integrity in our products from start to finish. That's why we are creating a program that touches every product at Mozilla and provides a readable integrity summary. This integrity summary will include examples of how we incorporated our main pillars of integrity - privacy, security, safety, inclusion, and sustainability - in our products, and opportunities for creators and consumers to learn from and provide input on those decisions.

The ethical challenges that face internet technologies today are complex and intertwined, and no one expert or organization knows all the answers. So we decided to do what we do best - open source the work we've done in this program to understand the problems and ways to address them. We want to work together with YOU our brilliant community of creators, contributors, and consumers of our products, to do better for us all.

## program
The integrity program at Mozilla consists of two main elements: 

1) a semi-automated process in which product researchers, designers, engineers, and managers are empowered to use our resources and process to run integrity evaluations of their product using our set of self-assessment tools (toolkit, checklist, resources).

2) For complex challenges, product decisions, and ongoing program resource updates, the integrity program is made up of a team of ethical tech experts, maintains active communities with interested consumers, creators, and community members, as well as regular consultations with the integrity advisory council, made up of subject matter experts in related areas.

### self-assess
Use and contribute to our set of easy access resources built to serve internal and external product creators from product owners to user researchers.

1. toolkit
<br>High level framework for shared terminology, standard best practices, and key resources for experience integrity across Mozilla products.

2. self-assessment checklist
<br>Baseline checklist for primary product stakeholders: product owners, designers, user researchers, and engineers.

3. [resource repository](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2695011/experience_integrity_public/library){target="blank"}
<br>Dynamic database of integrity related resources including industry guidelines, government regulations/frameworks, and academic research.

### consult
For internal teams at Mozilla, the experience integrity team is available to support in investigating product integrity needs that: 
* are not met through self-assessment process 
* product teams are not able to complete themselves 
* require multi-disciplinary and/or ethical expertise

For teams or product creators external to Mozilla and interested in the integrity program, we encourage you to get in touch! We love collaborating with our friends and colleagues across the industry: placeholder_email@mozilla.com. 

If you would like to be a participant in integrity at Mozilla, please get in touch! For those who are already Mozillians, become a part of our products for people advocacy group. For those external to the Mozilla community, consider tuning in or joining our advisory council of external experts.
