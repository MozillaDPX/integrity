# integrity toolkit

The integrity toolkit is a high level framework for product creators to design and develop ethical products that help users succeed and uphold basic human rights in societies around the world. This is how we build a better internet: by creating products that (1) amplify the good, promoting greater individual autonomy and agency over digital experiences and (2) filter out the bad by actively combatting pervasive harmful practices, such as surveillance, data extraction, and manipulation. 

We are focused on five pillars of integrity in our products: privacy, security, safety, inclusion, and sustainability. Basic descriptions, best practices, and key resources are outlined for each pillar below. For a more detailed, action-oriented resource about *how* to apply these best practices in product design and development, check out our self-assessment checklist.

For more information about the integrity program, check out the [README](https://github.com/MozillaDPX/integrity).


## using the toolkit
If you are new to building for integrity in products and/or trying to learn more, you may find it useful to read through the toolkit in its entirety. 

For readers with specific questions about one of the pillars, you can find high level descriptions, best practices, and useful resources for each area of experience integrity below (pillars are in no particular priority order). 

If you are a product owner, designer, or developer, you can use the experience integrity self-assessment (built on top of this toolkit) for a more direct approach in applying these principles in practice.

## integrity  pillars

### privacy
In the tech industry, privacy is often used as a synonym for data protection. However, at Mozilla, privacy goes beyond data access and manipulation. Not only do we consider the consequences of providing increasingly integrated tools for people in their lives; we thoughtfully consider the impacts of product decisions on the people and creators who use them through privacy by design.

People’s ability to trust the platforms they use online without the burden of feeling or being observed can impact how they learn, think, and express themselves. Many scholars believe freedom from surveillance serves as a fundamental tenet to a democratic, free-thinking society. Oftentimes, information about the people using a product is necessary for it to best serve their needs, and therefore trust and lean data collection are tools to meet people’s expectations from usefulness to ownership of their experience. [1, 2]

#### best practices
1. embed privacy by design
2. ensure privacy by default
3. protect personal identity and information
4. prevent harm to people and society
5. respect each person
6. responsible data collection

### security
Product security is about providing a trustworthy and reliable product, by limiting the risks our users and the business could face should something go wrong.

At Mozilla, we use the following concepts to think about security and risk:
* Confidentiality: sensitive user information and product assets (such as accounts credentials, secret API keys) are kept private and are protected appropriately against unauthorized access.
* Integrity: the software, services and information we deliver to consumers are reliable, trustworthy and protected against malicious attempts at modifying it.
* Availability: we deliver a continuity of service and we design it so that it doesn’t put users at a greater risk in a case it is down, by informing them or offering an alternative.

Security can be assessed with different and complementary aspects in mind such as the impact on the people who use our products, as well as business imperatives such as reputation of the company, productivity and finances.

#### best practices
We strongly encourage thinking about security at the different stages of life of the product/service: design and implementation of a new service or product, significant architecture changes and new features, maintenance.

1. KISS: Keep it simple and thus secure.
2. Apply the Principle of least privilege.
3. Design your product keeping Defense In Depth principles in mind.
4. Think about what could go wrong in the worst case scenario and do some threat modeling (see self-assessment Security section for more detailed guidelines).
5. Provide a medium to report and manage product security issues, fraud, and abuse.
6. Communicate security fixes transparently (e.g. product security advisories)
7. Monitor security fixes to third-party libraries to apply relevant security patches in the product in a timely manner.
8. Reach out for support to your security team.
