# integrity toolkit

## integrity @ Mozilla
Often referred to as trust, safety, corporate responsibility, or values in action, experience integrity at Mozilla refers to work across product, law, policy, and ethics to design and develop ethical and humane products that help users succeed and uphold the basic human rights of every individual in societies around the globe. This is how we build a better internet: by creating products that (1) amplify the good, promoting greater individual autonomy and agency over digital experiences and (2) filter out the bad by actively combatting pervasive harmful practices, such as surveillance, data extraction, and manipulation. 

We are focused on five pillars of integrity in our products: privacy, security, safety, inclusion, and sustainability. These pillars are covered in depth in this toolkit below.

For more information about the integrity program, check out the [README](https://github.com/MozillaDPX/integrity).


## using the toolkit
If you are new to the experience integrity program at Mozilla and/or trying to learn more, you may find it useful to read through the toolkit in its entirety. For readers with specific questions about one of the pillars, you can find high level descriptions, best practices, and useful resources for each area of experience integrity below (pillars are in no particular priority order). If you are a product owner, designer, or developer, you can use the experience integrity self-assessment (built on top of this toolkit) for a more direct approach in applying these principles in practice.

### Privacy
In the tech industry, privacy is often used as a synonym for data protection. However, at Mozilla, privacy goes beyond data access and manipulation. Not only do we consider the consequences of providing increasingly integrated tools for people in their lives; we thoughtfully consider the impacts of product decisions on the people and creators who use them through privacy by design.

People’s ability to trust the platforms they use online without the burden of feeling or being observed can impact how they learn, think, and express themselves. Many scholars believe freedom from surveillance serves as a fundamental tenet to a democratic, free-thinking society. Oftentimes, information about the people using a product is necessary for it to best serve their needs, and therefore trust and lean data collection are tools to meet people’s expectations from usefulness to ownership of their experience.

2. Ensure privacy by default
3. protect personal identity and information
