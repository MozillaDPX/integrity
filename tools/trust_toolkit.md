# user trust kit

This kit helps product creators build more trustworthy products and features.

## phase 01: design and technical specifications
Product/feature development begins with outlining design and technical specifications as a plan for eventual implementation. By reviewing our plans for trustworthiness at this phase, we can save time and resources by addressing problems earlier rather than later - once the product is built. 

### 1. What user need(s)/problem(s) does this product solve?
* State in simple, specific terms, as in: A (user role) who feels (negative feeling) about (reason) needs to (step) but faces (obstacle).
* If you are not sure, USER RESEARCH is needed to better understand your hypothesis and how specific user needs relate.

### 2. What are the product’s experience principles?
* Identify the most important themes for how and why your target audience will use this product
* If you’re not sure, conduct USER RESEARCH to facilitate this discovery.

### 3. Will the product prevent harm and abuse? If yes, please state how. If no, please justify why.
* If you are not sure, consider how the product will touch on security, privacy, and safety concerns using the following steps:
* Conduct a SECURITY REVIEW to strengthen threat model and security mitigations as well as understand safety concerns.
* Review Mozilla’s data privacy principles and lean data toolkit for more information.
Include a reporting mechanism.

### 4. Will the product increase equity? If yes, please state how. If no, please justify why.
* If you are not sure, receive review of specs by diverse stakeholders including by race, gender, disability, LGBTQIA+, and geographic location.
* USER RESEARCH may be needed to better understand the nuances of how the product concept might impact social equity.

### 5. Will the product promote the well-being of individuals, communities, and environment? If yes, please state how. If no, please justify why.
* If you are not sure, please review the user trust framework best practices for sustainability and identify how your product will meet these principles: clean, efficient, open, honest, regenerative, resilient.
