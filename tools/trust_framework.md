##  Background
This framework has been developed through the combination of findings from user survey data about trust in technology, the mozilla manifesto, subject matter expertise, and industry best practices. It is the third iteration of an effort to identify a trust framework at Mozilla ongoing since H2 2020, with the help of a wide range of expert stakeholders.
